       <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>What website did you study? Who is the target audience? What three tasks did you assign to your subjects?</h3>
        <p>We studied the Carrefour webpage, whos main target are kenyan shoppers, aswell as thoes of forgein countries, 
            who are either unable to go to groccery stores or would rather have their grocceries brought to them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search for spesific items.</li>
            <li>Items through digital pay.</li>
            <li>Includes recently viewed items. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Results</h2> 
        <h3>Were subjects able to complete the tasks you assigned them? Was it easy for them? How much time, or how many steps, did it take to complete the tasks?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes you can search for spesific items.</li>
            <li>yes you can buying items through digital pay.</li>
            <li> yes it includes recently viewed items. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>I Leared that carrefour is  accsesible to people who are wanting to do buy groceries online. The current design they have on their page is effective 
            and a close duplicate to that of amazon. We were also able to comple the assigned tasks and a easy and manverble way. On thing we would change about the
             formatting is the loggin page as it can be dircetly connected to google.</p>
